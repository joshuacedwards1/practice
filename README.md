# practice
A big thanks to freeCodeCamp for the instructions and guidance their courses provide. This repository is to show understanding and mastery of the challenges, lessons, and projects in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I first completed the challenges and projects using freeCodeCamp's embedded code editor. Afterwards, to cement the knowledge of the concepts taught and gain experience with a real world text editor, I wrote the same code in Visual Studio Code.
